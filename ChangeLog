Version: 0.5-0 (2020-03-09, released)

  * API change where exposure and calcCandidates now explicitly 
  return character vector instead of either factors or characters 
  based on stringsAsFactors.
  
  * Replace all global symbols in portfolio.R, portfolioBasic.R,

  replaced usage of `subset`.

  in R 4.0.0. Thanks to Paul Murrell and Thomas Lin Pedersen
  for suggestions on the fix.
